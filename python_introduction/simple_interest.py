# Define the variables according to the problem statement
principal = 1000   # Representing $1000
rate = 0.05        # Representing 5% annual interest rate
time = 3           # Representing 3 years

# Calculate the simple interest using the formula: I = P * R * T
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the result in the specified format
print("The simple interest is:", interest)
